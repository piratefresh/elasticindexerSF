    "description": "Add delicious pulled pork sandwiches to your menu with this Farm Promise No Antibiotics Ever all-natural bone-in pork butt! Though its name suggests otherwise, this cut of meat comes from the neck and shoulder of the hog. Since this is a muscular area of the animal, this cut has a good deal of connective tissue and is moderately tough, but don't let that put you off! When cooked low and slow, pork butt becomes melt-in-your mouth tender, allowing you to enjoy the exquisite flavor of this cut of meat. Because this product is made from hogs raised on small family farms, you'll be able to enjoy the hearty flavor that only comes from animals raised with care and individual attention. This product is left with the bone in, offering an opportunity for rustic presentation. The bone also helps to insulate the meat during cooking, helping to ensure that the meat around the bone will be extra succulent and tender!\n\nPork butt is a favorite cut for making pulled pork! Try your hand at this barbecue favorite by coating this pork butt in your favorite spice rub, then place it in an oven or grill preheated to 250 degrees Fahrenheit until the internal temperature is more than 190 degrees Fahrenheit. This will take around 8 hours, possibly longer depending on the thickness of the cut you're working with, your oven's temperature, and your desired level of doneness. When you're finished, allow the meat to rest for at least half an hour before pulling it apart, slathering in your favorite barbecue sauce, and serving! This bone-in pork butt is also a great candidate for smoking. Try smoking it over apple or hickory wood at 225 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 8 hours, or until the internal temperature is more than 190 degrees Fahrenheit. No matter how you choose to prepare it, this irresistible pork butt is the perfect way to feed a hungry crowd!\n\nYou care about the quality of the food you serve and so do your customers. When you buy Farm Promise products, you're getting more than just pork: their items come with a promise of quality and a commitment to goodness that your customers will be able to taste in every bite. This commitment starts on the farm - all Farm Promise animals are born and bred on American family farms and raised with individual care and attention. Every pig is bred with 100% crate-free gestation, raised with No Antibiotics Ever, and always fed a vegetarian diet. Farm Promise invests in their animals and in local agriculture not because it is easy, but because it is the right thing to do, and this commitment to goodness truly sets their products apart. By serving Farm Promise products, you can ensure you are serving your customers the finest pork available while showing them you care about your recipe's ingredients.",

    "description": "The epitome of high-quality fish, impress your guests with these Wulf's Fish 12 lb. collar on king kampachi skin-on fillets! With firm texture and a high fat content, king kampachi can be prepared in a variety of ways and serves as a great addition to your seafood menu. Farmed four miles off the coast of Mexico in the clear waters of the Gulf of California, this fish is grown in deep water with strong currents. The water quality is tested regularly for the highest adherence to environmental standards. This fish is recognized as sustainably and responsibly sourced by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC).\n\nKing kampachi boasts a clean, crisp bite when consumed raw and settles to a delicious buttery flavor when cooked. It's easy to prepare and incredibly versatile in your busy kitchen. Broil, grill, steam, pan-fry, roast, sear, or bake for a mouthwatering dish your customers can't resist. Dredge it in bread crumbs, fry it, and serve in thin strips on salad or your signature pasta. Try grilling this fillet and topping it with a garlicky pesto, or keep it uncomplicated by searing it with brown butter and lemon. Alternatively, offer it raw in a poke bowl, as a kampachi crudo with Calabrian chili vinaigrette, or oil-poached with rice, shiitake mushrooms, broccoli, and blood orange segments. These fillets come complete with their collars, which are great for grilling or roasting with bold sauces and glazes. Trust these collar on king kampachi fillets to diversify your seafood menu and impress your guests. This 12 lb. case comes with 4 fillets on average, but individual piece weight will vary.\n\nWulf's Fish originated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1926 with Sam Wulf. With an eye for quality, Sam set a precedent for building transparent business relationships and procured fresh seafood directly from the Boston Fish Pier every morning. While simultaneously promoting sustainable farming and fishing practices, he grew his business from a small, local shop to a national brand. Today, Wulf's Fish works with artisanal fishermen and farmers to provide premium, traceable seafood products. Trust Wulf's Fish to keep your kitchen stocked with the best, freshest, hand-cut seafood.\n\nBecause this item is not stocked in our warehouse, processing, transit times and stock availability will vary.

    "description": "Serve your customers a finger lickin' favorite with these Farm Promise No Antibiotics Ever baby back pork ribs! Because this product comes from hogs that are raised with care on small family farms, they're a menu item you can feel good about serving. These back ribs have a high meat-to-bone ratio, making them a filling choice for even your hungriest patrons. Serve these succulent ribs next to a steaming pile of mac 'n' cheese, creamy mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, or collard greens for a classic meal that's sure to satisfy. Don't forget to offer a few moist towelettes to help your customers clean up after enjoying this beloved finger food!\n\nThe secret to preparing fall-off-the-bone tender ribs is patience - cook your ribs low and slow for delicious results every time! Generously season the rack of ribs on both sides with your signature spice rub, then create a foil tent and cook them for several hours over low heat in your oven, grill, or smoker. Finish the ribs with your favorite barbecue sauce, or experiment with international flavors by adding a spicy Brazilian sauce or a sweet and acidic Korean glaze! No matter how you choose to serve them, these ribs are sure to be a delicious addition to your menu.\n\nYou care about the quality of the food you serve and so do your customers.

    "description": "Bissell Commercial BGUPRO18T Details\n\nKeep your office, restaurant, or hotel clean and allergen-free with the help of this Bissell Commercial BGUPRO18T 18\" dual motor bagged upright vacuum cleaner with on-board tools. This vacuum cleaner offers exceptional cleaning power with a reliable 1,000W dual motor system that requires just one pass to clean deep, moves air at up to 95 CFM, and offers 115\" of water lift. The motor is located in the base along with the brush roller to minimize handle weight and make operation comfortable for the user. The soft-touch comfort-grip handle also ensures optimal comfort, in addition to adjusting to accommodate different users. A motor inlet filter protects the internal components of this model, preventing dust and debris from clogging the motor housing. As an added safety feature, electric sensors within the unit detect if the belt is broken or the airflow is being blocked.\n\nThe BGUPRO18T is cleverly designed to provide exceptional performance and versatility. Along with manual brush roller height adjustment to compensate for different carpet heights and floor surfaces, the vacuum features a balanced center of gravity designed to prevent it from tipping when attachments are used. It also has a non-slip belt drive with overload protection. The vacuum comes with on-board tools that conveniently stow in the rear to help you tackle a variety of cleaning tasks. These include an upholstery brush, a crevice tool, and a dusting tool. When an attachment is in use, the roller brush automatically shuts off to protect carpets.\n\nThe vacuum's telescoping wand has a stretch hose allowing you to reach more than 9' away to clean surfaces well above floor level. Additionally, a sleek foot extending from the head of the unit is helpful for cleaning under furniture. The 46' long power cord also helps maximize your reach, as it is designed with a cord strain relief system to provide an area of use up to 96' from the power outlet. The dual-wall disposable bag has a 6.2 qt. capacity that gives you plenty of space to fill up before emptying is necessary. This vacuum operates at a sound level of 67 dB(A)\n\nOverall Dimensions:\nCleaning Path Width: 18\"",

    "createddate": "2021-05-15T21:11:27",
    "description": "Irresistibly rich, savory flavor and buttery, tender texture await your customers in every succulent bite of this Warrington Farm Meats 12 oz. New York strip steak! This steak is cut from the prized short loin and features moderate fat marbling throughout, giving it a richly beefy flavor. This legendary flavor, coupled with a texture so tender you can cut it with a fork, makes the New York strip a popular offering in steakhouses and fine dining establishments all over the world. When cooked to medium-rare perfection and served alongside tender, fresh vegetables or garlicky mashed potatoes, this first-class, boneless steak makes a truly show-stopping addition to your menu! Warrington Farm Meats' premium New York strip steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest steakhouses.\n\nThanks to a lack of dense muscle and connective tissue in this cut, this tender New York strip steak is perfect for fast cooking methods like grilling, searing, roasting, or broiling. You can even smoke it for an especially bold flavor or cook it sous vide to ensure an unadulterated taste and a perfect level of doneness! For optimal results, try dry-brining the steak in kosher salt overnight in your refrigerator. When it comes time to cook, rinse off the salt, pat dry with a paper towel, and sprinkle coarsely ground black pepper on each side. Because the New York strip steak does not need many other ingredients or sauces to deliver big flavor, this simple seasoning is perfect for enhancing the natural flavors of the beef while ensuring a crisp, brown crust and a tender, juicy interior.\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products. This family owned and operated company uses time-honored practices to craft premium meats that you can serve with pride. Their farm-raised beef comes from cows who spend their lives grazing on the lush, fertile pastures of Southeastern Pennsylvania, and every cut of meat is carefully processed and butchered by hand. From expertly trimmed pork and beef to patiently smoked, hand-stuffed sausages, your patrons will taste the quality of Warrington Farm Meats in every bite!",

Cut from the plate primal, these short ribs offer up big, beefy flavor that your meat-loving patrons are sure to appreciate. They're richly marbled with fat for unbeatable taste and cook up to a melt-in-your-mouth tender texture. This rib meat has been separated from the bone, offering extra meaty goodness that's perfect for shredding! Warrington Farm Meats' boneless beef short ribs come from local, farm-raised, -processed, and -butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness.\n\nThese short ribs have a moderate amount of connective tissue, making them great for low and slow cooking methods like braising, roasting, or smoking. When cooked over low heat for a long period of time, these short ribs will develop an irresistibly tender texture and mouthwatering depth of flavor! Season these short ribs to your liking with dry rubs or sweet and tangy barbecue sauces; once they're cooked, shred the rib meat and add it to sandwiches that'll have your hungry patrons coming back for more.\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products. This family owned and operated company uses time-honored practices to craft premium meats that you can serve with pride.

    "description": "Serve your customers a truly exquisite entree that they won't forget with this Warrington Farm Meats 5 oz. filet mignon! This steak is cut from the very tip of the tenderloin; because this muscle bears no weight, it never develops any dense connective tissue, making filet mignon the most tender cut of beef. This tenderness, coupled with its especially mild flavor, has made filet mignon arguably the most prized and valuable steak on the market. When cooked to medium-rare perfection and served alongside tender, fresh vegetables or garlicky mashed potatoes, this fork-tender, melt-in-your-mouth steak makes a truly show-stopping addition to your menu! Warrington Farm Meats' premium filet mignon steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest steakhouses.\n\nThanks to a lack of dense connective tissue in this cut, filet mignon is perfect for fast cooking methods like grilling or searing. However, avoid wasting time and money by overcooking this valuable and delicious piece of meat! Filet mignon is often served rare or medium rare to enhance the flavor and juicy texture of the meat. One fail-safe method for cooking this dainty steak is to begin by searing it in a cast iron pan for 5 minutes on both sides to brown the outside and develop a mouthwatering exterior, then transfer the pan to a 400 degree oven to ensure that the meat is evenly cooked through. You can also try cooking the steak sous vide in an immersion cooker, then searing the outside just before you serve it to achieve perfection every time!\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products. This family owned and operated company uses time-honored practices to craft premium meats that you can serve with pride.

This cut comes from the rib area of the pork loin, a section with plenty of fat marbling for rich flavor and a moderate amount of connective tissue, which helps the ribeye steak maintain its juiciness during the cooking process. Thanks to its rich, juicy flavor, this ribeye pork steak will allow you to create entrees that are sure to delight your guests! This 8 oz. steak will make a hearty entree, while their consistent sizing will help you control portions and costs.\n\nThis ribeye pork steak is a versatile cut of meat that is perfect for a variety of cooking methods. It can be seared, grilled, broiled, baked, or even fried! The versatility of this cut makes it a great addition to your menu. For a simple yet flavorful entree, create a dry rub with salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and garlic, then coat the meat and allow it to marinate for several hours. When it's time to cook, add the steak to a pan over medium heat and sear for approximately 3 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature is between 145 and 155 degrees Fahrenheit. When you serve this ribeye pork steak with classic, hearty sides like roasted potatoes, haricots verts, or roasted apples, it's sure to become a standout favorite on your menu!\n\nBased in Hatfield, PA, Hatfield, a part of Clemens Food Group, is a sixth-generation, family-owned business that prides themselves on operating on a higher level of standard to ensure that they are not just another pork supplier in the industry.

    "createddate": "2021-05-24T01:05:47",
    "description": "Did you know that not all bacteria are bad for you? In fact, there are many bacteria that are actually essential for our health, especially when it comes to digestion! Invite your patrons to balance their digestion while enjoying a great-tasting beverage with this Wonder Drink organic green tea and lemon prebiotic kombucha. Prebiotics are naturally occurring fibers that cannot be digested. Instead, when consumed, these fibers encourage the growth of healthy gut bacteria by providing them with the perfect surface to live and grown on, helping aid in healthy digestion while crowding out bad bacteria. While prebiotics occur naturally in many common foods like bananas, onions, and asparagus, you would have to eat a large enough of these foods to get the prebiotic benefits found in just one bottle of this Wonder Drink. Like all kombuchas, this beverage contains probiotics (live cultures of bacteria that aid in healthy digestion), but the addition of prebiotics makes this product a health powerhouse!\n\nIn addition to being great for you, this green tea and lemon kombucha tastes great, too! It's made from a blend of green and black tea that is fermented with live kombucha cultures and flavored with bright, zesty lemon to complement the earthy green tea. The result is a refreshing, lightly sweet sparkling beverage with a perfect balance of flavors and only 8 grams of sugar per serving. The probiotic cultures and prebiotic fibers in this beverage help to aid in health digestion, while naturally occurring antioxidants in the tea help to boost immunity and improve overall health. Unlike many kombuchas, Wonder Drink's proprietary two-step fermentation process creates a smooth, drinkable kombucha that has no unpleasant vinegary, acidic flavor. It's also guaranteed to contain less than 0.5% alcohol by volume, making this kombucha safe for everyone to enjoy. This delicious beverage makes a perfect accompaniment to healthy meals in your restaurant or cafe or it can be enjoyed on its own as a refreshing pick-me-up! Best of all, the eye-catching can design gives this product an attractive shelf-presence, making it perfect for offering in your reach-in refrigerator or open air merchandiser. While this beverage does not require refrigeration, it is best served chilled.\n\nOn a trip to Russia in the late 1990s, Stephen Lee became fascinated with kombucha. This tart, sparkling, gut-balancing beverage became his passion; before long, he was brewing his own kombucha, caring for his own Symbiotic Colony of Yeast and Bacteria (SCOBY), and even writing books about the health beverage! In 1999, Stephen founded Wonder Drink to help everyone enjoy the great-tasting benefits of this fermented drink. Wonder Drink's mission is to create delicious kombucha that offers consistency and great taste in every bottle. Their beverages are safe for everyone (kids included!) to enjoy and their innovative line of flavors offers something to satisfy every palette.\n\nKombucha Reset\n3/4 cup Wonder Drink organic green tea and lemon prebiotic kombucha\n1/2 cup water\n1/4 cucumber, peeled and sliced\n1/2 cup low-fat plain yogurt\n3-4 leaves of spinach or kale\n1/2 cup frozen or fresh blackberries\n5 ice cubes\n\nPlace all ingredients in a blender. Blend until smooth. Sip and enjoy!",

    "description": "Made with the freshest, finest ingredients, Seviroli 10 lb. cheese tortellini pasta is delicate and tender. The noodles wrap around a delicate combination of premium ricotta, Pecorino Romano, Parmesan, and asiago cheeses for a bold, irresistible flavor. Try it in a wide variety of dishes, from vegetable soups and creamy, Italian entrees to cold summer salads. The savory cheese pairs beautifully with fresh vegetables like sweet, sun-dried tomatoes and spinach with feta. For a richer meal, dress it up with a decadent cream sauce, or douse it in italian dressing for a lighter dish. However it's served, this tortellini embodies the scents and tastes of authentic Italian cooking, making any dish into delicious comfort food.\n\nTo prepare for service, lightly add salt to 4 qt. of water and bring it to a boil. Then pour in the tortellini, reducing the heat to a low simmer. Gently stir. Let the pasta cook for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. It should reach internal temperatures of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 seconds. When it has, drain and serve!\n\nAs a family-owned and operated business, Seviroli started off producing authentic Italian dishes with carefully-selected ingredients. Since its founding in the 1960s, little has changed; their sauces, desserts, and traditional filled pastas are still crafted with care, and their all-natural ingredients are still the finest and freshest the world has to offer. Today, Seviroli is the world's largest tortellini manufacturer, having won over chefs and families everywhere with the comforting tastes and aromas of quality Italian cooking.",

    "createddate": "2021-05-24T00:55:27",
    "description": "Create hearty and satisfying entrees that will get your patrons talking with this Hatfield Premium Reserve 10 oz. all-natural bone-in center cut pork chop! Hatfield Premium Reserve pork is prepared by using tried-and-true culinary techniques known as brining and larding, which improve each product's marbling and produces meat that's 30% more tender than conventional pork. This patient preparation means that this center cut pork chop compares to even the most delicious cuts of steak! This cut comes from the center of the pork loin, an area with moderate fat marbling and without a lot of connective tissue, creating a tender, flavorful piece of meat. These 10 oz. chops will make a hearty entree for even your hungriest guests, while allowing you to control costs and portions with consistent sizing.\n\nThis bone-in center cut pork chop is a versatile cut of meat that is perfect for a variety of cooking methods. It can be seared, grilled, broiled, baked, or even fried! The bone remains intact in this cut of meat, which helps to insulate the meat during cooking for a more tender texture and even doneness, and also offers a stunning visual presentation that can be perfectly plated. For a simple yet flavorful entree, create a dry rub with salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and garlic, then coat the meat and allow it to marinate for several hours. When it's time to cook, add the steak to a pan over medium heat and sear for approximately 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature is between 145 and 155 degrees Fahrenheit. When you serve this bone-in center cut pork chop with classic, hearty sides like roasted potatoes, haricots verts, or roasted apples, it's sure to become a standout favorite on your menu!\n\nBased in Hatfield, PA, Hatfield, a part of Clemens Food Group, is a sixth-generation, family-owned business that prides themselves on operating on a higher level of standard to ensure that they are not just another pork supplier in the industry.

Hatfield, Clemens Food Group's flagship brand, delivers a full line of quality pork products that are backed by their Pork with a Pledge program, which ensures that all Hatfield pork is ethically raised without growth promotants, as well as with no added hormones or steroids. All of their pork comes from trusted American family farms, with a large percentage of their pork being locally sourced from Lancaster County farms, which allows them to have better control of humane animal practices and sustainability. With mindfulness becoming a rapidly increasing food trend, more and more consumers are looking to eat higher quality meat that aligns with their values. By serving your customers Hatfield, you can ensure you are serving your customers quality meat, while showing them you care about your recipe's ingredients.",

    "name": "Warrington Farm Meats 10 oz. Frozen Coulotte Steak - 12/Case",
    "createddate": "2021-05-16T23:50:02",
    "description": "A truly versatile and mouthwatering cut of beef, impress your guests by adding this Warrington Farm Meats 10 oz. coulotte steak to your menu! Sometimes called top sirloin cap steak, coulotte steak is a lean, boneless cut that is the richest, most flavorful part of the top sirloin. Without extensive marbling, it draws most of its delectable flavor from the thin fat layer covering a single side of the cut. Its flavor and density make it ideal for broiling, roasting, and marinating for the grill. This coulotte steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest restaurants and steakhouses. Sustainably raised with no added hormones or antibiotics, this steak is a mouthwatering cut that packs delicious, savory beef flavor.\n\nFor best results on the grill, soak this steak in a marinade for up to one day, cook it on high heat for a short period of time to retain moisture, reduce the heat to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and remove the steak from the grill approximately 5 minutes before it reaches your preferred doneness as it will continue to cook after removal. Enhance the naturally savory flavor of this steak with the complementary flavors of cocoa and cumin. For a delicious mole coulotte, marinade the steak with a rub of cinnamon, cumin, cocoa, salt, pecans, and ancho and chipotle chilis. After letting it marinate overnight, roast it in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, sear it briefly in a hot pan on all sides, and slice it thinly against the grain for the ultimate tenderness. Pair this rich cut with tomatillo salsa, cilantro-lime rice, and roasted corn for a colorful, mouthwatering meal. Alternatively, this cut is wonderful for use on kebabs, steak sandwiches, stir fry, stew, burgers, shredded beef tacos, and barbecue dishes. With versatility and unmatched flavor, this coulotte steak will leave your guests satisfied every time.\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products. This family owned and operated company uses time-honored practices to craft premium meats that you can serve with pride. Their farm-raised beef comes from cows who spend their lives grazing on the lush, fertile pastures of Southeastern Pennsylvania, and every cut of meat is carefully processed and butchered by hand. From expertly trimmed pork and beef to patiently smoked, hand-stuffed sausages, your patrons will taste the quality of Warrington Farm Meats in every bite!",
