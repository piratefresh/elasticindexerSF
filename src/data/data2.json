    "description": "Irresistibly rich, savory flavor and buttery, tender texture await your customers in every succulent bite of this Warrington Farm Meats 12 oz. New York strip steak! This steak is cut from the prized short loin and features moderate fat marbling throughout, giving it a richly beefy flavor. This legendary flavor, coupled with a texture so tender you can cut it with a fork, makes the New York strip a popular offering in steakhouses and fine dining establishments all over the world. When cooked to medium-rare perfection and served alongside tender, fresh vegetables or garlicky mashed potatoes, this first-class, boneless steak makes a truly show-stopping addition to your menu! Warrington Farm Meats' premium New York strip steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest steakhouses.\n\nThanks to a lack of dense muscle and connective tissue in this cut, this tender New York strip steak is perfect for fast cooking methods like grilling, searing, roasting, or broiling. You can even smoke it for an especially bold flavor or cook it sous vide to ensure an unadulterated taste and a perfect level of doneness! For optimal results, try dry-brining the steak in kosher salt overnight in your refrigerator. When it comes time to cook, rinse off the salt, pat dry with a paper towel, and sprinkle coarsely ground black pepper on each side. Because the New York strip steak does not need many other ingredients or sauces to deliver big flavor, this simple seasoning is perfect for enhancing the natural flavors of the beef while ensuring a crisp, brown crust and a tender, juicy interior.\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products. This family owned and operated company uses time-honored practices to craft premium meats that you can serve with pride. Their farm-raised beef comes from cows who spend their lives grazing on the lush, fertile pastures of Southeastern Pennsylvania, and every cut of meat is carefully processed and butchered by hand. From expertly trimmed pork and beef to patiently smoked, hand-stuffed sausages, your patrons will taste the quality of Warrington Farm Meats in every bite!",

    "description": "A truly versatile and mouthwatering cut of beef, impress your guests by adding this Warrington Farm Meats 10 oz. coulotte steak to your menu! Sometimes called top sirloin cap steak, coulotte steak is a lean, boneless cut that is the richest, most flavorful part of the top sirloin. Without extensive marbling, it draws most of its delectable flavor from the thin fat layer covering a single side of the cut. Its flavor and density make it ideal for broiling, roasting, and marinating for the grill. This coulotte steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest restaurants and steakhouses. Sustainably raised with no added hormones or antibiotics, this steak is a mouthwatering cut that packs delicious, savory beef flavor.\n\nFor best results on the grill, soak this steak in a marinade for up to one day, cook it on high heat for a short period of time to retain moisture, reduce the heat to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and remove the steak from the grill approximately 5 minutes before it reaches your preferred doneness as it will continue to cook after removal. Enhance the naturally savory flavor of this steak with the complementary flavors of cocoa and cumin. For a delicious mole coulotte, marinade the steak with a rub of cinnamon, cumin, cocoa, salt, pecans, and ancho and chipotle chilis. After letting it marinate overnight, roast it in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, sear it briefly in a hot pan on all sides, and slice it thinly against the grain for the ultimate tenderness. Pair this rich cut with tomatillo salsa, cilantro-lime rice, and roasted corn for a colorful, mouthwatering meal. Alternatively, this cut is wonderful for use on kebabs, steak sandwiches, stir fry, stew, burgers, shredded beef tacos, and barbecue dishes. With versatility and unmatched flavor, this coulotte steak will leave your guests satisfied every time.\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products.
