The exterior of this refrigerator is durable and sleek, with a stainless steel door and front with gray painted sides. The exterior grille that covers the refrigeration system is even easy to remove for preventative maintenance or to allow necessary repairs. Inside, the unit features a painted aluminum interior.\n\nPlus, the spring-loaded hinges ensure that the door closes properly, even when you have your hands full. If you are taking several loads to or from this unit, you can also override the self-closing system by opening the door 120 degrees so that it stays open until you manually close it. At the end of the day, take advantage of the door lock to secure your inventory.\n\nFor ample storage space, the 17.87 cu. ft. interior includes 3 heavy-duty epoxy coated wire shelves, making it easy to organize your cold ingredients. Bright LED lighting illuminates the interior too, so your staff can easily see and select the ingredients they need.\n\nWith a bottom mount balanced refrigeration system, the unit's refrigeration system is easy to view and access for preventative maintenance without a ladder. This design also keeps the compressor out of the heat of hot kitchens, as hot air rises. The refrigeration system itself features a hot gas condensate evaporation system and a forced-air design that ensures even temperatures throughout the unit. You can count on food safety with this unit since it holds product between 36 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit. This is achieved with environmentally-friendly R290 refrigerant, which boasts an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0 and a global warming potential (GWP) of 3. The refrigerant and the 1/4 hp compressor together deliver exceptional performance.\n\nFor simple maintenance, this unit features an adaptive defrost system. It also includes (4) 6\" heavy-duty casters, making it easy to move around for cleaning and service. Two of the casters even lock to keep it stationary when in use.

    "createddate": "2021-05-18T23:18:20",
    "description": "Serve your customers a truly exquisite entree that they won't forget with this Warrington Farm Meats 5 oz. filet mignon! This steak is cut from the very tip of the tenderloin; because this muscle bears no weight, it never develops any dense connective tissue, making filet mignon the most tender cut of beef. This tenderness, coupled with its especially mild flavor, has made filet mignon arguably the most prized and valuable steak on the market. When cooked to medium-rare perfection and served alongside tender, fresh vegetables or garlicky mashed potatoes, this fork-tender, melt-in-your-mouth steak makes a truly show-stopping addition to your menu! Warrington Farm Meats' premium filet mignon steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest steakhouses.\n\nThanks to a lack of dense connective tissue in this cut, filet mignon is perfect for fast cooking methods like grilling or searing. However, avoid wasting time and money by overcooking this valuable and delicious piece of meat! Filet mignon is often served rare or medium rare to enhance the flavor and juicy texture of the meat. One fail-safe method for cooking this dainty steak is to begin by searing it in a cast iron pan for 5 minutes on both sides to brown the outside and develop a mouthwatering exterior, then transfer the pan to a 400 degree oven to ensure that the meat is evenly cooked through. You can also try cooking the steak sous vide in an immersion cooker, then searing the outside just before you serve it to achieve perfection every time!\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products. This family owned and operated company uses time-honored practices to craft premium meats that you can serve with pride. Their farm-raised beef comes from cows who spend their lives grazing on the lush, fertile pastures of Southeastern Pennsylvania, and every cut of meat is carefully processed and butchered by hand. From expertly trimmed pork and beef to patiently smoked, hand-stuffed sausages, your patrons will taste the quality of Warrington Farm Meats in every bite!",

This steak is cut from the prized short loin and features moderate fat marbling throughout, giving it a richly beefy flavor. This legendary flavor, coupled with a texture so tender you can cut it with a fork, makes the New York strip a popular offering in steakhouses and fine dining establishments all over the world. When cooked to medium-rare perfection and served alongside tender, fresh vegetables or garlicky mashed potatoes, this first-class, boneless steak makes a truly show-stopping addition to your menu! Warrington Farm Meats' premium New York strip steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest steakhouses.\n\nThanks to a lack of dense muscle and connective tissue in this cut, this tender New York strip steak is perfect for fast cooking methods like grilling, searing, roasting, or broiling.

For optimal results, try dry-brining the steak in kosher salt overnight in your refrigerator. When it comes time to cook, rinse off the salt, pat dry with a paper towel, and sprinkle coarsely ground black pepper on each side. Because the New York strip steak does not need many other ingredients or sauces to deliver big flavor, this simple seasoning is perfect for enhancing the natural flavors of the beef while ensuring a crisp, brown crust and a tender, juicy interior.\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products.

    "createddate": "2021-05-16T23:50:02",
    "description": "A truly versatile and mouthwatering cut of beef, impress your guests by adding this Warrington Farm Meats 10 oz. coulotte steak to your menu! Sometimes called top sirloin cap steak, coulotte steak is a lean, boneless cut that is the richest, most flavorful part of the top sirloin. Without extensive marbling, it draws most of its delectable flavor from the thin fat layer covering a single side of the cut. Its flavor and density make it ideal for broiling, roasting, and marinating for the grill. This coulotte steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest restaurants and steakhouses. Sustainably raised with no added hormones or antibiotics, this steak is a mouthwatering cut that packs delicious, savory beef flavor.\n\nFor best results on the grill, soak this steak in a marinade for up to one day, cook it on high heat for a short period of time to retain moisture, reduce the heat to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and remove the steak from the grill approximately 5 minutes before it reaches your preferred doneness as it will continue to cook after removal. Enhance the naturally savory flavor of this steak with the complementary flavors of cocoa and cumin. For a delicious mole coulotte, marinade the steak with a rub of cinnamon, cumin, cocoa, salt, pecans, and ancho and chipotle chilis. After letting it marinate overnight, roast it in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, sear it briefly in a hot pan on all sides, and slice it thinly against the grain for the ultimate tenderness. Pair this rich cut with tomatillo salsa, cilantro-lime rice, and roasted corn for a colorful, mouthwatering meal. Alternatively, this cut is wonderful for use on kebabs, steak sandwiches, stir fry, stew, burgers, shredded beef tacos, and barbecue dishes. With versatility and unmatched flavor, this coulotte steak will leave your guests satisfied every time.\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products. This family owned and operated company uses time-honored practices to craft premium meats that you can serve with pride. Their farm-raised beef comes from cows who spend their lives grazing on the lush, fertile pastures of Southeastern Pennsylvania, and every cut of meat is carefully processed and butchered by hand. From expertly trimmed pork and beef to patiently smoked, hand-stuffed sausages, your patrons will taste the quality of Warrington Farm Meats in every bite!",

    "description": "Beverage-Air RB72HC-1G Details\n\nThis Beverage Air RB72HC-1G 75\" Vista series three section glass door reach-in refrigerator is the perfect solution to cold storage in your restaurant kitchen, bakery, or other commercial food preparation area. The exterior of this refrigerator is durable and clean-looking with a stainless steel front and gray painted sides. This unit features an aluminum interior with foamed-in CFC and HCFC-free polyurethane insulation for superior temperature retention, even in kitchens with high ambient temperatures.\n\nThis unit features three energy efficient double pane glass doors so that you can easily view your cold foods without needing to open a door. This reduces energy loss and helps keeps your refrigerator from working harder than it needs to! The spring loaded hinges ensure that the doors close properly even when you have your hands full. If you are taking several loads to or from this unit, you can also override the self-closing system by opening the doors 120 degrees so that they stay open until you manually close them. Plus, the plug-in magnetic door gaskets offer a positive seal but are still easy to remove for cleaning.\n\nThe interior of this unit features 72 cu. ft. of cold storage and has 9 heavy-duty epoxy-coated wire shelves for safe, sanitary storage. Each shelf comes with four shelf clips that must be field installed and which allow the shelves to be adjusted in 1/2\" increments. In addition, this glass door refrigerator comes with LED interior lighting so that you can easily identify and locate the items that you need.\n\nThe bottom mount balanced 1/2 hp refrigeration system is easy to reach for maintenance and cleaning. Plus, the exterior grille is easy to remove for preventative maintenance or to allow necessary repairs. The refrigeration system itself features an automatic condensate evaporation system for greater energy efficiency and a forced air design that ensures even temperatures throughout the unit. The epoxy-coated evaporator helps prevent corrosion, too. An added benefit to a bottom mount refrigeration system is that it raises the interior floor of the unit to reduce bending and lifting when you are loading or unloading food. And, since the top of the unit is solid, you can use it as additional storage space for food pans, towels, and more!\n\nYou can count on food safety with this refrigerator since it holds product at 36-38 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, this unit uses environmentally-friendly R-290 refrigerant in a self-contained refrigeration system to help meet your goals of making your foodservice business more eco-friendly. To help you achieve your safety and sanitation standards, this refrigerator comes with (4) 6\" heavy-duty casters, two locking, so the unit may be easily moved for cleaning.\n\nThis unit runs on eco-friendly R-290 refrigerant. This specialized refrigerant has an ozone depletion (ODP) of 0 and a global warming potential (GWP) of 3, making it an environmentally-responsible choice for your business.\n\nOverall Dimensions:\nWidth: 75\"\nDepth: 33 3/4\"\nHeight (with casters): 84\"\nCapacity: 72 cu. ft.\n\nInterior Dimensions:\nWidth: 72\"\nDepth: 28 1/2\"\nHeight: 61 3/4\"\n\n\nThis Item Ships via Common Carrier.
