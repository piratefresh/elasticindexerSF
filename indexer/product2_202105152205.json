		"description": "Irresistibly rich, savory flavor and buttery, tender texture await your customers in every succulent bite of this Warrington Farm Meats 12 oz. New York strip steak! This steak is cut from the prized short loin and features moderate fat marbling throughout, giving it a richly beefy flavor. This legendary flavor, coupled with a texture so tender you can cut it with a fork, makes the New York strip a popular offering in steakhouses and fine dining establishments all over the world. When cooked to medium-rare perfection and served alongside tender, fresh vegetables or garlicky mashed potatoes, this first-class, boneless steak makes a truly show-stopping addition to your menu! Warrington Farm Meats' premium New York strip steak comes from local, farm-raised, processed, and butchered beef to ensure quality control, ethical animal practices, and an unrivaled freshness that makes it worthy of being served in the world's finest steakhouses.\n\nThanks to a lack of dense muscle and connective tissue in this cut, this tender New York strip steak is perfect for fast cooking methods like grilling, searing, roasting, or broiling. You can even smoke it for an especially bold flavor or cook it sous vide to ensure an unadulterated taste and a perfect level of doneness! For optimal results, try dry-brining the steak in kosher salt overnight in your refrigerator. When it comes time to cook, rinse off the salt, pat dry with a paper towel, and sprinkle coarsely ground black pepper on each side. Because the New York strip steak does not need many other ingredients or sauces to deliver big flavor, this simple seasoning is perfect for enhancing the natural flavors of the beef while ensuring a crisp, brown crust and a tender, juicy interior.\n\nSince 1974, Warrington Farm Meats has been combining decades of experience with a passion for perfection to create world-class meat products. This family owned and operated company uses time-honored practices to craft premium meats that you can serve with pride. Their farm-raised beef comes from cows who spend their lives grazing on the lush, fertile pastures of Southeastern Pennsylvania, and every cut of meat is carefully processed and butchered by hand. From expertly trimmed pork and beef to patiently smoked, hand-stuffed sausages, your patrons will taste the quality of Warrington Farm Meats in every bite!",
